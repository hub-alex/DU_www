   <h1>Computer video card history</h1>
    <img src="/img/mda.webp" alt="MDA is the first text-only video display standard from IBM capable of displaying at a maximum of 80x25 characters in two colors. ">
    <h2>1981</h2>
    <p>IBM developed its first two video cards, the MDA (Monochrome Display Adapter) and CGA (color graphics adapter), in 1981. The MDA had 4 KB of video memory, and the CGA had 16 KB of video memory.</p>
    <h2>1983</h2>
    <p>Intel entered the video card market by introducing the iSBX 275 Video Graphics Multimodule in 1983. It was capable of displaying eight colors and a 256 x 256 resolution.</p>
    <h2>1987</h2>
    <p>The VGA (video graphics array) standard was released in 1987, providing a video resolution of 640 x 480 with 16 colors and up to 256 KB of video memory. ATI introduced its first VGA video card, the ATI VGA Wonder. Some VGA Wonder cards even featured a mouse port for mouse connectivity.</p>

    <h2>1991</h2>
    <p>S3 entered the video card market with its S3 911 and 911A graphics chips, which provided up to 256-color graphics quality. S3 mostly sold its graphics chips to OEM (original equipment manufacturer) manufacturers to integrate into computer motherboards, due to its low cost and lower quality.</p>
    <h2>1999</h2>
    <p>NVIDIA released the GeForce 256 GPU (graphics processing unit) on October 11, 1999. It was considered the first GPU worldwide and fully supported DirectX 7. It also featured 32 MB of DDR (double data rate) memory.</p>
